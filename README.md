CocoaPods Dependency Manager is a comprehensive graphical tool designed to bring simplicity and power to the process of managing external libraries in Xcode. This application serves as a full-featured front-end for the CocoaPods command-line utility, providing a streamlined, visual approach to handling project dependencies.

It offers robust functionality for adding, removing, and updating pods across single or multiple targets.
